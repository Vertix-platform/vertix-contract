# Vertix Smart Contracts

## Overview
Vertix is a decentralized marketplace where people can trade digital assets. This includes creator-branded NFTs, in-game items, digital accounts, websites, domains, apps, etc. It uses a combination of Polygon and Base technology to ensure secure, clear, and trustworthy transactions. The smart contracts allow for various NFT functions, such as borrowing, staking, and selling. They also provide secure ways to handle manual transfers and ensure that assets are authentic.

## Features
- **NFT Trading**: Mint, trade, borrow, stake, and sell creator-branded NFTs and in-game items.

- **Escrow System**: Secure escrow-like smart contracts for safe manual transfers of digital assets.

- **Verification**: Ensures authenticity of digital assets, including accounts, domains, apps, etc.

- **Hybrid Architecture**: Leverages Polygon for low-cost, high-speed transactions and Base for scalability.

- **Decentralized Marketplace**: Trustless trading for gamers, creators, and digital entrepreneurs.

## Prerequisites
- **Foundry**: Ensure you have ([Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)) installed.

- **Node.js**: Required for dependency management.

- **Polygon & Base Nodes**: Access to Polygon and Base RPC endpoints for deployment and testing.
